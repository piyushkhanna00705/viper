 Caption: A laptop computer is open and sitting on a table next to a glass of wine. The table is set with a candle and a wine glass, creating a cozy atmosphere.
 Query: Why is this plugged in?
Code Reviewer LLM: Condition-1: The code is not utilizing hints from the image caption. The caption describes a laptop computer on a table with a glass of wine, candle, and wine glass, creating a cozy atmosphere. However, the code is searching for object patches related to "plug" which is not mentioned in the caption. The code can be refined by searching for object patches related to "laptop" or "computer" instead.

Condition-2: The llm_query() function usage is correct as the string starts with an 'f' and there are no variables inside the f-string from previous steps.
