 Caption: A laptop computer is open and sitting on a table next to a glass of wine. The table is set with a candle and a wine glass, creating a cozy atmosphere.
 Query: Why is this plugged in?
Code Reviewer LLM: Condition-1: The code is not fully utilizing the hints from the image caption. The caption describes a laptop computer, but the code is using a generic term "object" to find the patches. The code could be refined to specifically look for a "laptop computer" instead of a generic "object". 

Condition-2: The llm_query() function usage is correct. It uses a formatted string (f-string) that starts with 'f' and includes a variable from a previous step, which is {object_name}.

 Refine the code based on the feedback so that Condition-1 and Condition-2 are satisfied.

 Caption: A laptop computer is open and sitting on a table next to a glass of wine. The table is set with a candle and a wine glass, creating a cozy atmosphere.
 Query: Why is this plugged in?
Code Reviewer LLM: Condition-1: The code is relevant to the caption since it tries to find the plug and device which the caption is describing. The code can leverage the fact that the caption describes a laptop computer. 

Condition-2: llm_query() function usage is correct as the string starts with an 'f' and there is a variable inside the f-string from previous steps. The variable is 'device_name' which is obtained from the simple_query() function.
