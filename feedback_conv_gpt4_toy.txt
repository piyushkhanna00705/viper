Message to Reviewer LLM:  def execute_command(image) -> str:

 Caption: A man is sitting in a pew at a church, wearing a backpack and holding a teddy bear. The teddy bear is positioned on his back, and he appears to be looking at it. There are other people in the church as well.
 Query: What toy is this?
Code Reviewer LLM: Condition-1: The code does not utilize hints from the image caption. The caption describes a scene in a church where a man is holding a teddy bear. The code could be refined to leverage this hint by querying specifically about the teddy bear.

Condition-2: The code does not use the llm_query() function, and therefore does not meet the requirement of using a formatted string that begins with the letter 'f'. The code should be revised to use the llm_query() function with a formatted string.

 Refine the code based on the feedback so that Condition-1 and Condition-2 are satisfied.

 Caption: A man is sitting in a pew at a church, wearing a backpack and holding a teddy bear. The teddy bear is positioned on his back, and he appears to be looking at it. There are other people in the church as well.
 Query: What toy is this?
Code Reviewer LLM: Condition-1: The code is relevant to the caption since it tries to find out what toy is being referred to in the caption. The code can leverage the fact that the caption describes a teddy bear. 

Condition-2: The code does not use the llm_query() function, so it does not violate the condition about the use of f-string. However, if the llm_query() function was to be used, it should be used with an f-string that starts with 'f'.
