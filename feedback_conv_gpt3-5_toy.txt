 Caption: A man is sitting in a pew at a church, wearing a backpack and holding a teddy bear. The teddy bear is positioned on his back, and he appears to be looking at it. There are other people in the church as well.
 Query: What toy is this?
Code Reviewer LLM: Answer:
Condition-1: The code is not utilizing hints from the image caption. The caption describes a man sitting in a church with a teddy bear, but the code does not take this information into account. It simply searches for the word "toy" in the image.

Condition-2: The llm_query() function usage is correct as the string starts with an 'f' and there are no variables inside the f-string from previous steps.

 Refine the code based on the feedback so that Condition-1 and Condition-2 are satisfied.
